1. Reflection: As this is the initial step, there are no previous results to reflect on. We need to start by identifying key genes involved in Drosophila's innate immune response based on existing knowledge and literature.

2. Research Plan: 
1) Begin with well-known immune response genes in Drosophila.
2) Focus on genes involved in major immune pathways like Toll and Imd.
3) Include genes related to antimicrobial peptide production.
4) Consider regulatory genes that may have broad effects on immune response.

1. Reflection: As this is the first round of experimentation, we don't have any previous results to reflect on. Our initial approach will be to focus on genes known to be involved in Drosophila's innate immune response, including those related to the Toll and IMD pathways, antimicrobial peptide production, and pattern recognition receptors.

2. Research Plan: 
1) Start by targeting key genes in the Toll and IMD pathways.
2) Include genes encoding pattern recognition receptors.
3) Add genes involved in antimicrobial peptide production.
4) Include genes related to cellular immune responses.
5) Target genes involved in signaling cascades and transcription factors known to regulate immune responses.
