Human: Step 0
 You are a scientist working on problems in drug discovery.

Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 32 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).


Now let's start!

1. Reflection: This is the initial step, so we have no previous results to reflect on. The challenge requires an efficient strategy to identify key genes regulating IFNG production from a large set of possibilities with limited experimental capacity.

2. Research Plan: 
- Start with genes known to be involved in immune response pathways and cytokine signaling since IFNG is a key immune cytokine
- Focus on transcription factors and upstream regulators that could have broad effects on IFNG production
- Target genes in the JAK-STAT pathway which is known to regulate IFNG
- Include genes involved in T cell activation and differentiation as IFNG is primarily produced by T cells
- Test genes involved in cellular stress response and inflammatory pathways that might affect IFNG production
