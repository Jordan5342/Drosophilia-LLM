  "Task": "Identify genes important for gene_essentiality_screen from the provided dataset.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENE SELECTION:\n- You MUST select genes that exist in the provided dataset\n- ALL genes in this dataset use the format GENE_XXXXX where XXXXX is a number\n- Do NOT use biological gene names like CDK2, TP53, BRCA1, MYC, etc.\n- ONLY use genes from the dataset in format GENE_XXXXX\n\nEXAMPLES OF VALID GENES IN THIS DATASET:\nHigh importance: GENE_9491, GENE_10303, GENE_15048, GENE_10304, GENE_15049\nMedium importance: GENE_5524, GENE_5525, GENE_5526, GENE_5527, GENE_5528\nLow importance: GENE_86, GENE_330, GENE_648, GENE_760, GENE_784\n\nWhen making predictions, you must:\n1. Consider the gene importance scores provided\n2. Select genes in the GENE_XXXXX format only\n3. Choose genes that exist in the dataset\n4. Focus on genes with high scores for positive selection\n\nRemember: This is a numbered gene dataset, not a biological gene name dataset.",
  "Measurement": "Gene importance score derived from construct frequency and biological relevance. Scores range from 0.01 to 1.0, where higher scores indicate more important/essential genes."
