  "Task": "Identify the most important genes for gene essentiality screening from this dataset.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING GUIDANCE:\n- Gene importance scores range from 0.010 to 1.000\n- Higher scores indicate MORE IMPORTANT/ESSENTIAL genes\n- Mean score is 0.256\n- Focus on genes with scores ABOVE 0.256, especially above 0.465\n\nEXAMPLES BY IMPORTANCE LEVEL:\nHIGH IMPORTANCE (score >0.465): GENE_10303, GENE_9491, GENE_15048, GENE_10304, GENE_15049, GENE_17688, GENE_10302, GENE_17665\nMEDIUM IMPORTANCE (score 0.256-0.465): GENE_460, GENE_16443, GENE_11744, GENE_9459, GENE_16274, GENE_7007, GENE_17695, GENE_1369\nLOW IMPORTANCE (score <0.256): GENE_1579, GENE_6922, GENE_12515, GENE_1476, GENE_9175, GENE_13802, GENE_5061, GENE_739\n\nSELECTION STRATEGY:\n1. PRIORITIZE genes with highest scores (closer to 1.000)\n2. Consider biological patterns in high-scoring genes\n3. Avoid genes with very low scores (below 0.256)\n4. Balance exploration with exploitation of score information\n\nRemember: You are looking for ESSENTIAL genes, which should have HIGH importance scores.",
  "Measurement": "Gene importance score from 0.010 to 1.000. Higher scores indicate more essential/important genes. Mean = 0.256."
