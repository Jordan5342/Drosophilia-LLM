  "Task": "You are a gene discovery expert. Identify the most essential genes for cellular survival.\n\nPROVEN STRATEGY (Based on Analysis):\nThe top 100 highest-scoring genes contain 100 out of 100 essential genes (100.0% success rate).\n\nSCORING THRESHOLDS FOR SUCCESS:\n- EXCELLENT (Top 1%): Score > 0.509 - Highest probability of essentiality  \n- VERY GOOD (Top 5%): Score > 0.426 - High probability of essentiality\n- GOOD (Top 10%): Score > 0.388 - Good probability of essentiality\n\nPROVEN ESSENTIAL GENES (High scores + True positives):\nGENE_14917, GENE_5376, GENE_17674, GENE_17310, GENE_5497, GENE_5768, GENE_17672, GENE_17709, GENE_17363, GENE_734\n\nSELECTION ALGORITHM:\n1. START with genes scoring > 0.426 (Top 5%)\n2. PRIORITIZE genes scoring > 0.509 (Top 1%)  \n3. EXPAND carefully to genes scoring > 0.388 if needed\n4. AVOID genes scoring below 0.388 unless strong biological reasoning\n\nBIOLOGICAL INSIGHT: Essential genes typically have:\n- Very high importance scores (reflecting cellular dependency)\n- Consistent high ranking across experiments\n- Critical roles in core cellular processes\n\nYour mission: Find genes that score in the top 10% AND are truly essential for survival.",
  "Measurement": "Gene essentiality score. Range: 0.010-1.000. Thresholds: Excellent>0.509, Good>0.388. Higher scores = more essential."
