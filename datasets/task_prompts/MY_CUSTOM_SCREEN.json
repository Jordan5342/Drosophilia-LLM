  "Task": "Expert gene essentiality discovery using proven patterns.\n\nPROVEN SUCCESS PATTERNS (from previous discoveries):\n\u2705 CONFIRMED ESSENTIAL GENES: GENE_10303, GENE_15048, GENE_10304, GENE_15049, GENE_10302, GENE_17688, GENE_17665, GENE_17662\n\u2705 SUCCESS SCORE THRESHOLD: All winners scored \u2265 0.428\n\u2705 AVERAGE WINNER SCORE: 0.800\n\u2705 HIGH-VALUE RANGES: Genes in ['10000s', '15000s', '17000s'] ranges showed success\n\nADVANCED SELECTION STRATEGY:\n1. PRIMARY: Select genes scoring \u2265 0.800 (proven winner zone)\n2. SECONDARY: Consider genes scoring 0.428-0.800 (potential winners)\n3. PATTERN: Look for genes in successful ranges: ['10000s', '15000s', '17000s']\n4. AVOID: Genes scoring < 0.428 (low success probability)\n\nEXAMPLES OF IDEAL TARGETS:\n- GENE_10303 (score: 1.000) \u2705 PERFECT\n- GENE_15048 (score: 0.952) \u2705 EXCELLENT  \n- GENE_17688 (score: 0.929) \u2705 VERY HIGH\n\nYour mission: Find genes matching these proven success patterns.",
