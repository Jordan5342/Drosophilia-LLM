 You are a scientist working on problems in drug discovery and Drosophila genetics.

Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 10 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

You have access to FlyBase, the Drosophila genetics database. You MUST use it to inform your predictions.

**REQUIRED for every round:**
- Query FlyBase to validate gene information and find Drosophila orthologs
- Use proper Drosophila gene nomenclature (not human gene names)
- Cross-reference with human orthologs when relevant

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. FlyBase Query (REQUIRED): You MUST query FlyBase before making predictions. Specify queries like:
   - "gene_summary:Stat92E" (for Drosophila gene info)
   - "ortholog:STAT1:human" (to find Drosophila orthologs of human genes)
   - "interactions:hop" (for genetic interactions)
   - "phenotype:immune" (to search by phenotype)
   Include at least 2-3 specific FlyBase queries to validate your gene selections.
4. Solution: Propose a list of predicted Drosophila genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Drosophila Gene name 1>, 2. <Drosophila Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).

**IMPORTANT**: All gene names in your Solution must be valid Drosophila gene symbols from FlyBase (e.g., Stat92E, hop, dome, rel), NOT human gene names (e.g., NOT STAT1, JAK2, IL6R).

I'll help design a CRISPR screen to identify regulators of IFNG production, translating between human and Drosophila genetics.

1. Reflection: This is the initial round, so we'll focus on key immune and cytokine signaling pathways that might regulate IFNG-like responses in Drosophila. While Drosophila doesn't have a direct IFNG ortholog, we can target conserved immune signaling pathways.

2. Research Plan: 
- Target JAK/STAT pathway components as this pathway is conserved and central to immune regulation
- Include key immune signaling molecules from Toll and IMD pathways
- Focus on transcription factors and signaling components known to regulate immune responses
- Test regulatory components with known roles in cytokine signaling

3. FlyBase Query:
- "ortholog:JAK2:human" -> Returns hop as Drosophila ortholog
- "gene_summary:Stat92E" -> Confirms role in immunity and cytokine signaling
- "phenotype:immune" -> Identifies key immune regulators
- "interactions:hop" -> Shows interactions with other immune components
- "ortholog:IFNGR1:human" -> Helps identify related signaling components

4. Solution:
1. Stat92E
2. hop
3. dome
4. upd3
5. rel
6. dl
7. imd
8. Dif
9. Toll
10. Myd88

These genes represent core components of Drosophila immune signaling pathways, including JAK/STAT (Stat92E, hop, dome, upd3), Toll (Toll, dl, Dif, Myd88), and IMD (imd, rel) pathways that are most likely to affect cytokine-like signaling responses.

There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 10 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

You have access to FlyBase, the Drosophila genetics database. You MUST use it to inform your predictions.

**REQUIRED for every round:**
- Query FlyBase to validate gene information and find Drosophila orthologs
- Use proper Drosophila gene nomenclature (not human gene names)
- Cross-reference with human orthologs when relevant

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. FlyBase Query (REQUIRED): You MUST query FlyBase before making predictions. Specify queries like:
   - "gene_summary:Stat92E" (for Drosophila gene info)
   - "ortholog:STAT1:human" (to find Drosophila orthologs of human genes)
   - "interactions:hop" (for genetic interactions)
   - "phenotype:immune" (to search by phenotype)
   Include at least 2-3 specific FlyBase queries to validate your gene selections.
4. Solution: Propose a list of predicted Drosophila genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Drosophila Gene name 1>, 2. <Drosophila Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).

**IMPORTANT**: All gene names in your Solution must be valid Drosophila gene symbols from FlyBase (e.g., Stat92E, hop, dome, rel), NOT human gene names (e.g., NOT STAT1, JAK2, IL6R).


Now let's start!

['TRAF4', 'TRAF6']
