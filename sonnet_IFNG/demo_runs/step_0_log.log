 You are a scientist working on problems in drug discovery.

Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 64 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).


Now let's start!

1. Reflection: As this is the initial step, there are no previous results to reflect on. We need to start by developing a strategic approach to efficiently identify genes that regulate IFNG production using the limited number of perturbations available.

2. Research Plan: 
1) Begin with a literature review to identify known regulators of IFNG production. (Not started)
2) Use bioinformatics tools to predict potential regulators based on pathway analysis and gene expression data. (Not started)
3) Prioritize genes based on their likelihood of involvement in IFNG regulation. (Not started)
4) Design and conduct the initial round of CRISPR screening using the top predicted candidates. (Not started)
5) Analyze results and iteratively refine the candidate list for subsequent rounds. (Not started)

3. Solution: As this is the initial step, I don't have enough information to propose specific genes for testing. The first step would be to conduct the literature review and bioinformatics analysis to generate an initial list of candidate genes.

1. Reflection: As this is the initial step, there are no previous results to reflect on. We need to start by selecting a diverse set of genes to test in our first round of experimentation.

2. Research Plan: Begin with a broad selection of genes from different functional categories to cast a wide net. Follow up with more targeted selections based on initial results. Refine the gene list in subsequent rounds by focusing on pathways and genes that show promising effects on IFNG production. Use bioinformatics tools and existing literature to inform gene selections. Iterate this process over multiple rounds to narrow down the most influential genes.

2. Research Plan: We will complete the 64-gene set by adding 9 more genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and IFNG regulation. The plan includes selecting genes from different functional categories to ensure a comprehensive screen. After completing this set, we will proceed with the CRISPR screen to measure the log fold change in IFNG normalized read counts for each perturbation.

3. Solution: Here are 9 additional genes to complete the 64-gene set:

1. IL21R, 2. IKZF1, 3. NFIL3, 4. IFNGR1, 5. IFNGR2, 6. STAT5A, 7. STAT5B, 8. ZEB2, 9. SMAD3
