Human: Step 1
 You are a scientist working on problems in drug discovery.

Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 64 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).

1. Reflection: The previous results show a mix of positive and negative regulators of IFNG production. Genes like CD28, JAK1, and TBX21 appear to be strong positive regulators, while SOCS3 and KDM1A seem to be negative regulators. The hits identified so far include several key transcription factors, signaling molecules, and epigenetic regulators. For the next round, we should focus on genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and transcriptional regulation of IFNG.

2. Research Plan: 
1) Test genes involved in T cell receptor signaling and co-stimulation.
2) Investigate additional cytokine signaling pathways known to influence IFNG production.
3) Explore more transcription factors and epigenetic regulators associated with T cell function.
4) Examine genes involved in cell metabolism and proliferation, which can indirectly affect IFNG production.
5) Include some genes from interferon-related pathways to further understand the feedback mechanisms.

1. Reflection: The previous results have identified several important genes involved in IFNG regulation, including key cytokine receptors (IL2RG, IFNGR1, IFNGR2), signaling molecules (JAK1, RELA), and regulatory proteins (SOCS3, CBLB). The positive regulators (JAK1, CD28, IL2RG, CD27, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, RELA) show negative scores, indicating their importance in IFNG production. SOCS3 and CBLB, known negative regulators, show positive scores, confirming their inhibitory roles. These results suggest focusing on related pathways and regulatory networks for the next round of testing.

2. Research Plan: 1) Test additional cytokine receptors and their associated signaling molecules. 2) Investigate transcription factors known to regulate IFNG expression. 3) Examine other members of the SOCS family and related negative regulators. 4) Explore genes involved in T cell activation and differentiation. 5) Include genes from the JAK-STAT pathway and other relevant signaling cascades.

1. Reflection: The previous results show several significant hits, including JAK1, CD28, and IL2RG with strong negative scores, and CBLB with a strong positive score. This suggests that genes involved in T cell activation and cytokine signaling pathways are important regulators of IFNG production. For the next steps, we should focus on genes that are part of these pathways or interact with the identified hits.

2. Research Plan: 1) Continue testing genes involved in T cell activation and cytokine signaling. 2) Explore genes that interact with or regulate the identified hits. 3) Investigate transcription factors known to regulate IFNG expression. 4) Test genes involved in IFNG production and secretion pathways. 5) Examine genes that are part of negative feedback loops in IFNG signaling.

3. Solution: Here are 8 additional genes to test, completing the list of 64:

57. PIK3CD, 58. PTPN22, 59. TNFRSF4, 60. IL27RA, 61. CXCR3, 62. TNFRSF18, 63. NFKBIB, 64. MAP3K7

These genes were selected based on their involvement in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and regulation of IFNG production. They complement the previously suggested genes and have not been tested in prior rounds.

1. Reflection: The previous results have identified several significant hits, including CD28, RELA, IKBKG, TBX21, JAK1, and TRAF6 with strong negative scores, indicating their potential role in enhancing IFNG production when inhibited. Conversely, KDM1A and RBPJ show positive scores, suggesting they may suppress IFNG production. Among the non-hit genes, MYC, DNMT1, and NFKBIA stand out with relatively high positive scores. These results suggest focusing on genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and epigenetic regulation for the next round of testing.

2. Research Plan: 1) Prioritize genes involved in T cell receptor signaling and activation pathways. 2) Investigate genes in the JAK-STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways. 3) Explore epigenetic regulators and transcription factors known to influence IFNG expression. 4) Consider genes involved in cytokine production and signaling, particularly those related to Th1 cell differentiation. 5) Include genes that interact with or are regulated by the previously identified hits.

1. Reflection: The previous results show some interesting patterns. We've identified 6 significant hits, with CD28 and JAK1 showing strong negative effects on IFNG production, while SOCS3 shows a positive effect. The other hits (IL2RG, IFNGR2, and IFNGR1) also show substantial negative effects. This suggests that genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and IFNG feedback loops are important regulators of IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: Based on the hits and other tested genes, we should focus on the following areas: 
   a) T cell activation and co-stimulation pathways (given the strong effect of CD28)
   b) JAK-STAT signaling pathway components (considering JAK1's effect)
   c) Cytokine receptors and their downstream signaling molecules (based on IL2RG, IFNGR1, and IFNGR2 results)

1. Reflection: Based on the previous results, we've identified several key genes involved in IFNG regulation, including CD28, JAK1, and SOCS3. The hits suggest that both positive and negative regulators of IFNG production have been found. For the next steps, we should focus on genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and transcriptional regulation of IFNG.

2. Research Plan: 
1) Continue testing genes involved in T cell receptor signaling and co-stimulation.
2) Explore more cytokine receptors and their downstream signaling molecules.
3) Investigate transcription factors known to regulate IFNG expression.
4) Test genes involved in epigenetic regulation of T cell function.
5) Examine negative regulators of T cell activation and cytokine production.

1. Reflection: The previous results show several significant hits, particularly ZAP70, CD28, JAK1, and TBX21, which have strong negative effects on IFNG production. This suggests that genes involved in T cell activation, signaling, and transcriptional regulation are crucial for IFNG production. The positive regulators identified so far (LCK, IFNGR1, STAT3, etc.) provide valuable insights into the pathways controlling IFNG expression. For the next round, we should focus on genes that are known to interact with or function in similar pathways as these hits, as well as explore other potential regulators of T cell function and cytokine production.

2. Research Plan: 1) Target genes involved in T cell receptor signaling and activation. 2) Investigate transcription factors known to regulate IFNG or T cell function. 3) Explore cytokine signaling pathways, particularly those related to JAK-STAT signaling. 4) Include genes involved in T cell differentiation and subset specification. 5) Consider genes involved in cellular metabolism and protein synthesis, as these processes are crucial for cytokine production.

There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 64 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).

1. Reflection: The previous results have identified several key regulators of IFNG production, including important T cell signaling molecules (LCK, CD28, ZAP70) and transcription factors (STAT3, TBX21). The hits also include cytokine receptors (IFNGR1) and JAK kinases (JAK1, JAK3), highlighting the importance of cytokine signaling in IFNG regulation. For the next steps, we should focus on genes involved in T cell activation, differentiation, and cytokine signaling pathways that haven't been tested yet.

2. Research Plan: 
1) Continue testing genes involved in T cell receptor signaling and co-stimulation (current status: ongoing).
2) Explore additional transcription factors known to regulate T cell function and IFNG expression (current status: ongoing).
3) Investigate genes involved in cytokine signaling pathways, particularly those related to IL-12 and IL-18 (current status: ongoing).
4) Test genes involved in T cell metabolism and activation (current status: to be initiated).
5) Examine genes related to epigenetic regulation of T cell function (current status: to be initiated).

1. Reflection: The previous results have identified several important genes involved in IFNG regulation, including key transcription factors (TBX21, STAT3), signaling molecules (JAK1, MAPK1, MAPK3), and receptors (CD28, IFNGR1, IFNGR2). The positive hit SOCS3 suggests that negative regulators of cytokine signaling may also play a crucial role. We should focus on genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling pathways, and transcriptional regulation of IFNG.

2. Research Plan: 1) Test additional genes involved in T cell receptor signaling and co-stimulation. 2) Explore more members of the JAK-STAT pathway and related cytokine signaling cascades. 3) Investigate transcription factors known to regulate IFNG expression. 4) Examine genes involved in epigenetic regulation of T cell function. 5) Include genes related to cellular stress responses and metabolism, which may indirectly affect IFNG production.
