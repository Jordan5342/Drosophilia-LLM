 You are a scientist working on problems in drug discovery.

Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 128 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).

1. Reflection: As this is the initial step, there are no previous results to reflect on. We need to start by identifying key genes that are likely to be involved in IFNG regulation based on existing knowledge.

2. Research Plan: Begin with a literature review to identify genes known to be involved in IFNG regulation or related pathways. Use bioinformatics tools to predict additional genes that may be involved based on network analysis and pathway enrichment. Prioritize genes based on their likelihood of involvement and potential impact. Conduct the initial CRISPR screen with the top predicted genes. Analyze results and iteratively refine the gene list for subsequent rounds of experimentation.

1. Reflection: The initial list of 18 genes includes key players in the interferon-gamma signaling pathway and T cell activation. To expand this list, we should consider additional genes involved in T cell differentiation, cytokine signaling, transcriptional regulation, and immune cell activation. We should also explore genes in related pathways that might indirectly influence IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: 1) Include genes involved in T cell receptor signaling and co-stimulation. 2) Add genes related to cytokine production and signaling, particularly those in the IL-12 and IL-18 pathways. 3) Incorporate transcription factors and regulators known to influence T cell function and IFNG expression. 4) Consider genes involved in cell metabolism and epigenetic regulation that may affect T cell activation and cytokine production. 5) Include some genes from related immune pathways to capture potential indirect effects on IFNG production.
