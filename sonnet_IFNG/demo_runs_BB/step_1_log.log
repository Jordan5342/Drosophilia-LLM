Human: Step 1
 You are a scientist working on problems in drug discovery.

Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 64 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).

1. Reflection: The previous results have identified several key genes involved in IFNG regulation, including TBX21, CD28, JAK1, and TRAF6, which show strong negative effects on IFNG production. Positive regulators like KLF2 and SOCS3 have also been identified. The next steps should focus on exploring related pathways and potential interacting partners of these genes to uncover additional regulators.

2. Research Plan: 1) Test genes involved in T cell activation and differentiation. 2) Explore cytokine signaling pathways, particularly those related to IL-2 and IL-12. 3) Investigate transcription factors known to regulate IFNG expression. 4) Examine genes involved in JAK-STAT signaling pathway. 5) Assess genes related to NF-κB signaling, given the strong effect of RELA.

1. Reflection: Based on the previous results, we've identified several important genes involved in IFNG regulation, including key transcription factors (TBX21, RELA), signaling molecules (JAK1, JAK3, STAT3), and immune regulators (CD28, IL2RG). The next steps should focus on exploring additional genes in related pathways and potential regulatory networks to uncover more modulators of IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: Continue testing genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and transcriptional regulation of IFNG. Focus on genes in the JAK-STAT pathway, MAPK cascade, and NF-κB signaling, as these have shown significant effects. Explore epigenetic regulators and co-stimulatory molecules. Investigate genes involved in T cell differentiation and function, particularly those related to Th1 cell development.

3. Solution: Here are 6 additional genes to complete the list of 64:
59. NFATC4
60. RAC2
61. TNFRSF4
62. HDAC3
63. IL27RA
64. CXCR3
