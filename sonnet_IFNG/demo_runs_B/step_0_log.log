Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 64 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...

1. Reflection: As this is the initial step, there are no previous results to reflect on. We need to start by selecting an initial set of genes to test based on prior knowledge and literature.

2. Research Plan: 
1. Select an initial set of 64 genes based on known involvement in IFNG regulation or immune pathways. (Current step)
2. Conduct the first round of CRISPR screening with these 64 genes and analyze the results.
3. Based on the first round results, select the next set of genes to test, focusing on related pathways or genes with similar functions to the top hits.
4. Repeat the screening process for several rounds, refining the gene selection based on each round's results.
5. Conduct a final analysis to identify the most significant regulators of IFNG production.

1. Reflection: Based on the previously selected genes, we've covered a wide range of transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and signaling molecules known to be involved in IFNG regulation. To complete our list, we should consider additional genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and chromatin remodeling that may influence IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: Our current approach focuses on key regulators of IFNG production, including transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and signaling molecules. We've covered many important genes, but we need to expand our selection to include additional factors that may influence T cell activation and IFNG production. The next step is to add 16 more genes to complete our list of 64 for this round of experimentation.

3. Solution: Here are 16 additional genes to complete the list:

49. BATF, 50. IRF4, 51. NFATC2, 52. RELA, 53. IKZF1, 54. BCL6, 55. CREB1, 56. EP300, 57. CREBBP, 58. KAT2B, 59. SIRT1, 60. SMARCA4, 61. ARID1A, 62. CD28, 63. ICOS, 64. IL2RA

1. Reflection: The current list of 56 genes covers a wide range of important cellular processes and signaling pathways that could potentially regulate IFNG production. To complete the list of 64 genes, we should consider adding genes that are known to be involved in immune response regulation, cytokine signaling, and T cell activation, as these processes are closely related to IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: We will complete the list of 64 genes by adding 8 more genes that are likely to influence IFNG production. The focus will be on selecting genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and immune response regulation. After completing the list, we will proceed with the CRISPR screen to perturb these genes and measure the log fold change in IFNG normalized read counts. The results of this screen will inform our next steps in identifying key regulators of IFNG production.

3. Solution: Here are 8 additional genes to complete the list of 64:
57. IFNG, 58. IL12A, 59. JAK2, 60. STAT4, 61. CD28, 62. NFATC2, 63. IRF1, 64. IL18
