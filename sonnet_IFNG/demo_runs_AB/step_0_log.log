Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 64 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...

1. Reflection: As this is the initial step, there are no previous results to reflect on. We need to start by selecting a diverse set of genes to test in our first round of experimentation.

2. Research Plan: Begin with a broad selection of genes from different functional categories to cast a wide net. Follow up with more targeted selections based on initial results. Refine the gene list in subsequent rounds by focusing on promising pathways or gene families. Use bioinformatics tools and existing literature to inform gene selections. Iterate this process until we identify key regulators of IFNG production.

1. Reflection: The current list of 62 genes covers a wide range of factors involved in T cell activation, signaling pathways, and cytokine production relevant to IFNG regulation. To complete the list of 64 genes, we should consider adding genes that complement the existing selection and potentially provide new insights into IFNG regulation.

2. Research Plan: The plan involves conducting a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes regulating IFNG production. We've selected 62 genes based on their known or potential roles in IFNG regulation. We'll now add two more genes to complete the set of 64 for the first round of perturbation. After this, we'll measure the log fold change in IFNG normalized read counts for each perturbation and analyze the results to inform subsequent rounds of experimentation.

3. Solution: Here are the two additional genes to complete the list of 64:

1. Reflection: Based on the previously predicted genes, we have covered many key players in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and IFNG regulation. To complete our list, we should focus on additional genes involved in T cell differentiation, transcriptional regulation, and immune checkpoint pathways that may influence IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: Our plan is to identify genes regulating IFNG production through a genome-wide CRISPR screen. We have already selected 114 genes based on their known roles in T cell function and cytokine signaling. We will now add 14 more genes to complete our list of 128 genes for the first round of perturbation, focusing on additional regulatory factors and signaling molecules that may influence IFNG production.

3. Solution: Here are 14 additional genes to test:
1. NFKBIA, 2. IKZF1, 3. IKZF3, 4. PRDM1, 5. EOMES, 6. TNFRSF9, 7. CD27, 8. TNFSF14, 9. TNFRSF14, 10. KLRG1, 11. IL27RA, 12. IL10, 13. EZH2, 14. RUNX1

Human: Step 0
 You are a scientist working on problems in drug discovery.

Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 128 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. I'll provide a single additional gene to complete the list of 128 genes for this round.

1. Reflection: Based on the current list of 127 genes, we have covered many key players in T cell signaling, cytokine production, and immune regulation. To complete the list, we should consider adding another gene involved in the IFNG signaling pathway or T cell activation.

2. Research Plan: The plan remains to identify genes regulating IFNG production through a genome-wide CRISPR screen. We've selected 127 genes based on their known roles in T cell function and cytokine signaling. Adding one more gene will complete our first round of 128 genes for perturbation. After this, we'll analyze the results to inform subsequent rounds of experimentation.

3. Solution: Here is the additional gene to test, completing the list of 128:

128. IL27

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. I'll provide a proper response now.

1. Reflection: Based on the list of genes already selected, it appears we have covered many key genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and interferon-gamma production. The list includes transcription factors, signaling molecules, and receptors crucial for immune responses. To complete the list, we should consider adding another gene that may play a role in regulating IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: The current plan involves conducting a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes regulating IFNG production. We have selected 127 genes based on their known or potential roles in immune responses and IFNG regulation. Our next step is to add one more gene to complete the list of 128 genes for the first round of screening. After this, we will proceed with the CRISPR screen and analyze the results to identify key regulators of IFNG production.

3. Solution: Here is the additional gene to test, completing the list of 128:

128. NFKBIZ
