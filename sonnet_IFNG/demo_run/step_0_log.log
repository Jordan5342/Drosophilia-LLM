Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 128 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

1. Reflection: As this is the initial step, there are no previous results to reflect on. We need to start by selecting a diverse set of genes that could potentially regulate IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: Begin with a broad selection of genes from different functional categories and pathways known to be involved in immune responses and cytokine production. Follow up with genes that show promising results in subsequent rounds. Narrow down the selection based on the scores obtained, focusing on genes with high absolute log fold changes. Investigate potential interactions between genes that show significant effects. Conclude by validating the top candidates with individual gene perturbations.

2. Research Plan: Our plan is to conduct a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes regulating IFNG production. We've selected 126 genes based on known involvement in T cell function and cytokine production. We now need to add 2 more genes to complete our 128-gene set for the first round of screening. After this, we'll measure the log fold change in IFNG normalized read counts for each perturbation and analyze the results to inform subsequent rounds of experimentation.

1. Reflection: The initial list of 29 genes includes many key players in the IFNG signaling pathway and immune response. To complete the list of 128 genes, we should expand our focus to include additional cytokine receptors, transcription factors, signaling molecules, and genes involved in T cell activation and differentiation. We should also consider genes involved in epigenetic regulation and post-transcriptional modifications that might affect IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: Our plan is to systematically identify genes that may regulate IFNG production through various mechanisms. We'll focus on cytokine signaling pathways, T cell activation and differentiation, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional modifications. We'll also include genes involved in cellular stress responses and metabolism, as these can indirectly affect cytokine production.

Research Problem: I'm planning to run a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate the production of Interferon-gamma (IFNG). There are 18,939 possible  genes to perturb and I can only perturb 128 genes at a time. For each perturbation, I'm able to measure out the log fold change in Interferon-gamma (IFNG) normalized read counts which will be referred to as the score. I can only do a few rounds of experimentation.

Always respond in this format exactly:

1. Reflection: Thoughts on previous results and next steps. 
2. Research Plan: The full high level research plan, with current status and reasoning behind each proposed approach. It should be at most 5 sentences.
3. Solution: Propose a list of predicted genes to test separated by commas in this format: 1. <Gene name 1>, 2. <Gene name 2> ...
Do not include any genes from this prompt (since they're already tested).

1. Reflection: The initial list of 17 genes includes key players in the interferon-gamma signaling pathway and its regulation. To expand this list, we should consider additional genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, transcription factors, and other immune-related pathways that might influence IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: We will continue to focus on genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and transcription factors known to regulate IFNG. We'll also include genes from related immune pathways, epigenetic regulators, and some less obvious candidates to ensure a broad coverage. This approach will help us identify both direct and indirect regulators of IFNG production. We'll prioritize genes with known connections to immune responses but also include some novel candidates to potentially uncover new regulatory mechanisms.

1. Reflection: Based on the previously predicted genes, we've covered many key players in the IFNG signaling pathway and related immune processes. To complete our list, we should consider additional genes involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and transcriptional regulation that may influence IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: Our current approach has focused on major signaling pathways and transcription factors known to regulate IFNG. To complete the list, we'll include genes involved in T cell receptor signaling, additional cytokine receptors, and epigenetic regulators. This comprehensive approach should provide a broad view of potential IFNG regulators.

1. Reflection: As this is the initial step, there are no previous results to reflect on. We need to begin by selecting a diverse set of genes that could potentially influence IFNG production.

2. Research Plan: Start with a diverse set of genes known to be involved in immune response pathways, cytokine signaling, and transcription factors. Follow up with genes in related pathways based on initial results. Utilize pathway analysis and literature review to refine gene selection in subsequent rounds. Implement machine learning algorithms to predict high-impact genes as the experiment progresses. Conclude by validating top hits with individual gene perturbations.

1. Reflection: The current list of 63 genes covers a wide range of factors involved in T cell activation, cytokine signaling, and immune regulation. To complete the set of 64 genes, we should consider adding another gene that plays a crucial role in IFNG production or regulation.

2. Research Plan: The plan remains to identify genes regulating IFNG production through a genome-wide CRISPR screen. We've selected 63 genes based on their known roles in T cell function and cytokine signaling. We'll complete the set with one more gene, then proceed with the CRISPR screen to measure the log fold change in IFNG normalized read counts for each perturbation. After this round, we'll analyze the results to inform subsequent rounds of experimentation.
